<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

For taking the plunge into mobile development; I decided to solve a quick problem I faced on the weekly: calculating my stack size in poker. After winning a big hand (or loosing most of my stack) I found myself keeping track of my stack size on the iOS notes app while doing manual calculations. For an elegant and minimalistic solution, I created this!

Features:
* Swiftly get the total value of all your chips; combined with basic strategy, you can make more informed decisions on the table.
[ ] Calculate profits (or lack thereof).


### Built With
I went with React Native (was already familiar with React, and thought it was pretty cool!) although, will likely end up remaking this in Swift.
