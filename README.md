## About The Project

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/5E1FPA4.png)

For taking the plunge into mobile development; I decided to solve a problem I faced: calculating my stack (total value of all chips) in poker. Rather than keeping track of the stack in the iOS notes app, I created this as a more elegant solution.


Features:
- [x] Swiftly get the total value of all your chips; combined with basic strategy, you can make more informed decisions on the table.

- [ ] Calculate profits (or lack thereof).


### Built With
Opted for React Native, as I'm already familiar with React. For the development environment I used Expo, to test the app on iOS.
